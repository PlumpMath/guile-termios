    The ‘manual’ branch of guile-termios
  ----------------------------------------

This branch contains pre-built versions of the library's reference manual, for
each release of the library, in order to remove the need to have the relatively
heavy dependency on ‘pandoc’ and a ‘latex’ distribution from the project.

This branch contains:

  - doc/guile-termios.3 - Unix manpage
  - doc/guile-termios.html - HTML Markup with included CSS
  - doc/guile-termios.pdf - Portable Document Format

Current version: v0.4
