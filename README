POSIX termios interface for GNU Guile

To query and change settings of serial devices on POSIX systems, the termios
API is used. GNU Guile doesn't have an interface for that based in. This module
implements this interface by use of Guile's dynamic FFI.

The problem with Guile's dynamic FFI is, that if you need to make use of
preprocessor macros, typesets or platform-specific struct layouts it seems to
fall a little short.

To get this working anyway, this module does this:

  - Use ‘gen-gps.scm’ to generate ‘gen-platform-specifics.c’.

  - Use ‘gen-platform-specifics.c’ to generate ‘scheme/termios/system.scm’.


This module was so far only tested on Debian Linux with GNU libc using GNU
Guile 2.0.9.

To generate, byte-compile and install the module, use these steps:

  % make
  % make compile
  # make install

If you got more than one version of guile installed, you may use the
GUILE_BINARY make variable to point the build-system to the right binary:

  # make install GUILE_BINARY=/usr/local/bin/guile
