POSIX termios interface for GNU Guile

To query and change settings of serial devices on POSIX systems, the termios
API is used. GNU Guile doesn't have an interface for that based in. This module
implements this interface by use of Guile's dynamic FFI.

The problem with Guile's dynamic FFI is, that if you need to make use of
preprocessor macros, typesets or platform-specific struct layouts it seems to
fall a little short.

To get this working anyway, this module does this:

  - Use ‘gen-gps.scm’ to generate ‘gen-platform-specifics.c’.

  - Use ‘gen-platform-specifics.c’ to generate ‘scheme/termios/system.scm’.
