 User-visible changes in guile-termios
=======================================

* 0.2 → 0.3 (released 2014-10-03):

  - Cygwin support

    This requires Guile 2 in cygwin, which at the time of writing does not
    exist as a pre-built package. If all dependencies are installed, though,
    Guile 2.0 builds fine.

  - Added ‘termios-failure?’

  - Added access to ‘errno’

    - get-errno
    - call-with-errno

  - Added high-level module (termios with-exceptions)

  - Added an actual test-suite (on top of the general plausibility test

  - Licence switched to 2-clause BSD.
